    "\n",
    "A whiff in baseball is a very straight forward concept, it's when a batter swings at a pitch and misses. While simple, it is also one of the most important stats in modern baseball. Understanding how and how often pitchers get whiffs is crucial to effectivley evalulate pitchers. A pitcher who is unable to miss bats rarley gets very far in the league. A quick look at the leaderboard for whiffs in 2024 is quite revealing."

It's pretty obvious a high amount of whiffs is genreally the sign of an elite pitcher. But how well do they correlate with a pitchers run prevention ability, which is the baseline job of a pitcher. For this we will look at whiff rate (simply # of whiffs / # of pitchers) for all qualified  starting pitchers from 2024 and compare to their ERA+ (in order to take park factors into account).\n"
